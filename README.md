# Cyclistic-Case-Study

This is my first upload to github and performing my first data analysis for a case study on Cyclistic.

The files in this repository are... <br>
    The analysis in .html format. <br>
    The analysis in .pdf format. <br>
    The analysis in .docx format. <br>
    My cleaning .R file. <br>
    My analysis .R file. <br>
    My change log .docx file. <br>
    My .rmd file.

Like I wrote this is my first attempt at this so if there is anything I should adjust please feel free to comment.

The analysis in .html and .docx are unable to load on site so they will need to be downloaded to be view in their respective formats. <br>
The analysis in .pdf format will appear on site.
